# MapDB

## Description

MapDB is a standalone in-memory key-value store application, similar to Redis and KeyDB, but implemented in Go. It provides a fast, lightweight, and efficient in-memory database solution. MapDB is designed to be compatible with Redis libraries, offering high performance and simplicity in its usage and integration. It aims to serve as a powerful tool for developers needing a robust in-memory database for their applications.
## Installation

MapDB can be run locally or using Docker.
